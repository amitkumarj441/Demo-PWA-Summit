### What is a Progressive Web App?
    A progressive web app is: 
    
    1. Progressive - Works for every user, regardless of browser choice because it's built with progressive enhancement as a  core tenet.
    
    2. Responsive - Fits any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.
    
    3. Connectivity independent - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low-quality networks.
    
    4. App-like - Feels like an app to the user with app-style interactions and navigation because it's built on the app shell model.
    
    5. Fresh - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
    
    6. Safe - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and to ensure content hasn't been tampered with.
    
    7. Discoverable - Is identifiable as an "application" thanks to W3C manifest and service worker registration scope, allowing search engines to find it.
    
    8. Re-engageable - Makes re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.
    
    9. Installable - Allows users to "keep" apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.
    
    10. Linkable - Easily share via URL, does not require complex installation.
